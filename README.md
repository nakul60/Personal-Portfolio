# Personal-Portfolio
Hey there! This is my Personal Portfolio 
<br>
I have made my Personal Website/Portfolio using pure HTML5 and CSS.
<h4>Important Tips:</h4>
1) For Resume: Bring your resume from your local machine into your VScode and add the path in the anchor tag (href).
2) For Image: Adjust the height and width of your image and the "div" accordingly.
3) For Links: Change the href of anchor tags accordingly.
